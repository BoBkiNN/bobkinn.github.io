Hello and welcome to my website!
People online call me Bob and I am a student from Kazakhstan.
Mostly, I am a technical administrator for Minecraft servers and a programmer.\n
I have been programming for 4 years - at first, I was making Discord bots in Python,
then I started creating my first Bukkit plugins in Java, and after that, I am learning Kotlin, Compose and Vue
(little by little)<br>
Formally, I am working on the second season of a Minecraft server.<br>
I love eating sandwiches and staying at home under a blanket.
